# Security Data Archive Service

!!! info "Illustrative Scenario"
    This example is intentionally generic and does not identify any particular storage platform, analysis product or organisation.

## Scenario

A security operations function maintains a large archive of historical security data on an internal storage service.

A small number of authorised administrators require a management capability to browse, retrieve and manage archived information.

The environment is restricted, network paths are controlled and access permissions are enforced by the storage service.

## Traditional Assurance View

Conventional assurance may examine:

- encryption in transit;
- authentication;
- authorisation;
- privileged access;
- object permissions;
- audit logging;
- software provenance; and
- administrative workstation security.

## The ORSM Lens

ORSM asks whether the management solution remains proportionate to its narrow operational purpose.

> **Does additional security architecture materially reduce risk, or does it introduce more complexity and support burden than the service warrants?**

## Relevant Domains

- **Protection Intent**
- **Complexity Management**
- **Operational Sustainability**
- **Human Factors**
- **Dependency Resilience**

## Key Questions

- What administrative functions are actually required?
- Which controls already exist at the storage, network and administrative layers?
- Does the management capability introduce unnecessary external dependencies?
- Can permissions be enforced by the underlying service rather than duplicated elsewhere?
- How difficult is the management component to patch and support?
- Is the operating model understandable to its administrator population?
- Does the proposed architecture preserve the simplicity of the original use case?

## Illustrative Finding

The storage service may already provide the required authentication, transport protection and object-level authorisation.

Introducing additional intermediary services could duplicate existing protections while increasing support and recovery complexity.

## Potential ORSM Outcome

**Retain / Improve**

Retain the simplest architecture that demonstrates adequate protection and operational supportability.

## ORSM Lesson

**A control does not become more effective merely because another control is placed in front of it.**

Security benefit must justify architectural complexity.
