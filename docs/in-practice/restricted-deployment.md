# Automated Deployment into a Restricted Environment

!!! info "Illustrative Scenario"
    This scenario is a fictional composite. It deliberately omits identifiable platforms, suppliers, environment names and implementation details.

## Scenario

An organisation develops infrastructure and application changes within an engineering environment and promotes approved artefacts into a more restricted operational environment.

Deployment is performed through a controlled automation path rather than routine direct administrator access.

The architecture introduces orchestration services, execution components, artefact repositories, credentials and approval mechanisms.

## Traditional Assurance View

Conventional assurance may examine:

- source integrity;
- peer review;
- artefact integrity;
- separation of duties;
- privileged access;
- deployment authorisation;
- vulnerability assessment; and
- audit logging.

## The ORSM Lens

ORSM asks whether the deployment mechanism itself has become a **critical operational dependency**.

> **Can the organisation still administer, recover or rebuild the restricted environment if the normal automation chain is unavailable?**

## Relevant Domains

- **Protection Intent**
- **Complexity Management**
- **Operational Resilience**
- **Recovery Engineering**
- **Dependency Resilience**

## Key Questions

- How many services must remain healthy for a deployment to succeed?
- Where is trust established between orchestration and execution components?
- Does the deployment mechanism create standing privileged trust?
- Can execution components validate the source and integrity of instructions?
- Can the restricted environment be recovered without the primary orchestration capability?
- What happens if the artefact repository is unavailable?
- Is there an independently controlled recovery path?
- Has automation reduced risk, or merely moved privileged trust into another architectural layer?

## Illustrative Finding

The automated deployment model may substantially reduce direct privileged access while simultaneously concentrating trust in a small number of orchestration services.

The resulting architecture is therefore dependent upon those services remaining secure, available and recoverable.

## Potential ORSM Outcome

**Improve / Redesign**

Potential improvements may include:

- stronger instruction authenticity;
- simplified execution dependencies;
- independent recovery capability;
- separation between routine deployment and emergency recovery; and
- explicit testing of orchestration failure scenarios.

## ORSM Lesson

**Removing human privilege does not remove architectural trust.**

Automation changes where trust resides.

ORSM requires those trust relationships to remain visible, justified and survivable.
